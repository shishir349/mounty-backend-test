It is a web app to add a product to the inventory and also to buy that.
I was not aware of the Docker, so Iw as not able to bulid this website using that.
But certainly I have hosted it on a platform, so It becomes easy for you to view it.

Time for creating this was very less, I tried learning Docker, but was unsuccesfull.
I hope you will understand.
